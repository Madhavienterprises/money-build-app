    <h3>1. Covered Call</h3>
    <p>
      A Covered Call involves holding a long position in a stock while selling a call option on the same stock.
      It’s used to generate income on top of stock holdings.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You own 100 shares of Reliance at ₹2400, and you sell a call option with a strike price of ₹2500 expiring in 1 month for ₹50 premium.</p>

    <h3>2. Protective Put</h3>
    <p>
      A Protective Put is used to hedge against potential losses in a stock you already own. You buy a put option to limit downside.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You own TCS at ₹3500 and buy a put option with a strike of ₹3400. If stock falls below ₹3400, the put protects your losses.</p>

    <h3>3. Long Call</h3>
    <p>
      A Long Call is a bullish strategy where you buy a call option to profit from rising stock prices with limited risk.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You buy an Infosys ₹1600 call for ₹30. If Infosys rises above ₹1630, you start making profit.</p>

    <h3>4. Long Put</h3>
    <p>
